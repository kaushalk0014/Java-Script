<h1>JavaScript Closures</h1>
 
 <h2>
	ðŸ”¹ Why Event Loop Exists
		JavaScript is single-threaded (it can only do one thing at a time).
		But we still need to handle things like:
		User interactions (clicks, inputs)
		Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
		Network requests (fetch/axios)
		Promises / asyncâ€“await
		ðŸ‘‰ The event loop is what lets JavaScript handle asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread.
		
		ðŸ”¹ Summary

		JS runs synchronously by default.
		Event loop allows async tasks by managing the call stack and task queues.
		Microtasks (Promises) run before macrotasks (setTimeout) in each tick.
