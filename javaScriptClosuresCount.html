<h1>JavaScript Closures</h1>
 
 <h2>
	ðŸ”¹ What is a Closure?

	A closure is created when a function "remembers" variables from the scope in which it was defined, even after that outer scope has finished executing.

	ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms:
	A closure gives an inner function access to variables of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
	
	ðŸ”¹ Why Closures Are Useful

	Data privacy (encapsulation)

	Maintaining state without global variables

	Callbacks & async code (e.g., event listeners, setTimeout)
 </h2>

<script>
	
	 function createCounter(){
		let a =1;
		
		return function(){
			  a = a+1;
			  return a;
		} 		 
	 }

	const counter = createCounter();
	
		console.log(counter());
		console.log(counter());
		console.log(counter());

</script>
