 <h2>
ðŸ”¹ What is async/await?
	async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises.
	It makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability.
	async keyword â†’ makes a function return a Promise.
	await keyword â†’ pauses the execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

<script>
	 
	 function fetchData(){
		return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
			setTimeout(()=>{
				resolve("Data received!");
			},2000);
		});
	 }
	 
	 async function runSequential(){
		const a = await fetchData();
		const b = await fetchData();
		
		console.log(`a = ${a},  b = ${b}`);
	 } 
	  
	 runSequential();// calling function
