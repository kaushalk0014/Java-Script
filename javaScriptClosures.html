 <h2>
	ðŸ”¹ What is a Closure?

	A closure is created when a function "remembers" variables from the scope in which it was defined, even after that outer scope has finished executing.

	ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms:
	A closure gives an inner function access to variables of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
 </h2>

<script>
	
	function outer(){
	 
		let a = 10;
		
		console.log(`Outer a = ${a}`);
		function inner(){
			a= a+5;
			
			console.log(`Inner a = ${a}`);
		}
		
		return inner;
		
	}

	const data = outer();
	
		data();
		data();

</script>
