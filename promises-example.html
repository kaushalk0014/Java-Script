<h1>Promise Example</h1>
 
 <h2>
🔹 What is a Promise?
	A Promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
	It may complete now, later, or never.
	Promises give a cleaner way to handle async work than callbacks.

🔹 Promise States
	Pending → initial state (still working).
	Fulfilled → operation completed successfully → returns a value.
	Rejected → operation failed → returns a reason (error).
	Once fulfilled/rejected, the state is settled (can’t change again).
 </h2>

<script>
	
	const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	  setTimeout(() => {
		resolve("Success!");
		// reject("❌ Error occurred!");
	  }, 2000);
	});

	myPromise
	  .then(result => console.log(result)) // handles resolve
	  .catch(error => console.error(error)) // handles reject
	  .finally(() => console.log("Done!"));
